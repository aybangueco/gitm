# gitm

A simple cli application to manage multiple git cli accounts.

## Motivation

I noticed that there is no built in functionality in git itself, when managing accounts especially, if you have multiple personality (account). Typing git config commands is kind of a hassle repeatedly, that's why i created this simple cli application.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/aybangueco/gitm
```

## TODO

- [x] Add account
- [ ] Display lists of account in a table
- [ ] Update account (pending)
- [x] Switch account
- [x] Delete account
